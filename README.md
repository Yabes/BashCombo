BashCombo
=========

A little combo system for your Terminal emulator !

All of the names comes from Skullgirls.


# Install #

Just put '.bash_combo' in your home and run :

	echo ". ~/.bash_combo" >> ~/.bashrc
	echo "export PROMPT_COMMAND='combo'" >> ~/.bashrc

Or if you already use PROMPT_COMMAND, add combo at the beginning of your command.
